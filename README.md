# SCM Digital Platform

This project was designed for the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), an independent, non-governmental, non-profit civil organization with international presence, including operations and partnerships in Europe.

Due to initially undefined project requirements, the platform was first approached as a news-oriented website. As the project evolved, it was restructured into a comprehensive digital platform focused on reporting, research, and professional support services. The final outcome was delivered as a flexible foundation, allowing future development and expansion by the organization.
